    Some details about how the disease is spread are still being determined. The WHO and the U.S. 
    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say it is primarily spread during close contact 
    and by small droplets produced when people cough, sneeze or talk; with close contact being within 
    approximately 1–3 m (3–10 ft). Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads. Loud talking 
    releases more droplets than normal talking. A study in Singapore found that an uncovered cough 
    can lead to droplets travelling up to 4.5 meters (15 feet). An article published in March 2020 
    argued that advice on droplet distance might be based on 1930s research which ignored the effects
    of warm moist outbreath surrounding the droplets and that an uncovered cough or sneeze can travel
    up to 8.2 metres (27 feet).</p>

    Respiratory droplets may also be produced while breathing out, including when talking. Though the 
    virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioaerosol 
    transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned in the hallway outside of people's 
    rooms yielded samples positive for viral RNA. The droplets can land in the mouths or noses of 
    people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Some medical procedures such as 
    intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be 
    aerosolised and thus result in airborne spread. Initial studies suggested a doubling time 
    of the number of infected persons of 6–7 days and a basic reproduction number (R0) of 2.2–2.7, 
    but a study to be published on April 7, 2020 calculated a much higher median R0 value of 5.7.

    It may also spread when one touches a contaminated surface, known as fomite transmission, and 
    then touches one's eyes, nose or mouth. While there are concerns it may spread via feces, this 
    risk is believed to be low.</p>
<p>    
    The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; while spread may be possible before 
    symptoms emerge, the risk is low. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 
    says while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person generally infects
     two to three others.

    The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces. Specifically, the virus was found to be 
    detectable for one day on cardboard, for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 
    stainless steel (AISI 304), and for up to four hours on 99% copper. This, however, varies 
    depending on the humidity and temperature. Surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of 
    solutions (with one minute of exposure to the product achieving a 4 or more log reduction 
    (99.99% reduction)), including 78–95% ethanol (alcohol used in spirits), 70–100% 2-propanol 
    (isopropyl alcohol), the combination of 45% 2-propanol with 30% 1-propanol, 0.21% sodium 
    hypochlorite (bleach), 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 0.23–7.5% povidone-iodine. Soap and detergent 
    are also effective if correctly used; soap products degrade the virus' fatty protective layer, 
    deactivating it, as well as freeing them from skin and other surfaces. Other solutions, such as 
    benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.
